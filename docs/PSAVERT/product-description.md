### Main Overview
The dataset file included with this product is provided in CSV format. The included dataset contains the following columns: 
`DATE`, `PSAVERT`
 
This dataset contains a historical time-series data of the Personal Saving Rate (PSAVERT) starting from `1959-01-01`. 

The values within the data field labeled `PSAVERT` represent the personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income (DPI), frequently referred to as "the personal saving rate," and calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI at the time of the corresponding `DATE` field. The unit of the data column is Percent and the values are based on seasonally adjusted annual rate. The BEA account code for this dataset is `A072RC`.

Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.
