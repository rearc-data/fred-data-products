### Main Overview
The dataset file included with this product is provided in CSV format. The included dataset contains the following columns: 
`DATE`, `T5YIE`
 
This dataset contains a historical time-series data of the 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T5YIE) starting from `2003-01-02`. 

The values within the data field labeled `T5YIE` represent a measure of expected inflation derived from 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities (BC_5YEAR) and 5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity Securities (TC_5YEAR) at the time of the corresponding `DATE` field. The latest value implies what market participants expect inflation to be in the next 5 years, on average. The unit of the data field is Percent and the values are not seasonally adjusted.

Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the [U.S. Treasury Department](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).
