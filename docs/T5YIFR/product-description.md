The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/fred-data-products](https://github.com/rearc-data/fred-data-products).

### Main Overview
The dataset file included with this product is provided in CSV format. The included dataset contains the following columns: 
`DATE`, `T5YIFR`
 
This dataset contains a historical time-series data of the 5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (T5YIFR) starting from `2003-01-02`. 

The values within the data field labeled `T5YIFR` represent a measure of expected inflation (on average) over the five-year period that begins five years from today at the time of the corresponding `DATE` field. The unit of the data field is Percent and the values are not seasonally adjusted.

This series is constructed as:

`(((((1+((BC_10YEAR-TC_10YEAR)/100))^10)/((1+((BC_5YEAR-TC_5YEAR)/100))^5))^0.2)-1)*100`

where `BC10_YEAR`, `TC_10YEAR`, `BC_5YEAR`, and `TC_5YEAR` are the 10 year and 5 year nominal and inflation adjusted Treasury securities. All of those are the actual series IDs in FRED.

Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the [U.S. Treasury Department](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).
