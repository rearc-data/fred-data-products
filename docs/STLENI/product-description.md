### Main Overview
The dataset file included with this product is provided in CSV format. The included dataset contains the following columns: 
`DATE`, `STLENI`
 
This dataset contains a historical time-series data of the St. Louis Fed Economic News Index: Real GDP Nowcast (STLENI) starting from `2013-04-01`. 

The values within the data field labeled `STLENI` represent the Percent Change at Annual Rate of the St. Louis Fed Economic News Index: Real GDP Nowcast (STLENI) at the time of the corresponding `DATE` field. The values are based on seasonally adjusted annual rate.

St. Louis Fed’s Economic News Index (ENI) uses economic content from key monthly economic data releases to forecast the growth of real GDP during that quarter. In general, the most-current observation is revised multiple times throughout the quarter. The final forecasted value (before the BEA’s release of the advance estimate of GDP) is the static, historical value for that quarter.
